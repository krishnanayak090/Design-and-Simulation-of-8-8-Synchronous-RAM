# Design-and-Simulation-of-8-8-Synchronous-RAM


This project implements and simulates an 8×8 Synchronous Random Access Memory (RAM) using Verilog HDL.
The memory has 8 locations (addresses), each capable of storing 8‑bit data. All operations (read and write) are synchronized with the clock.

✨ Features
8 memory locations (3‑bit address).
8‑bit data input and output.
Synchronous write and read on the positive clock edge.
Testbench provided for functional simulation.
